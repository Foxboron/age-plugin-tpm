TPM plugin for age clients
==========================

`age-plugin-tpm` is a plugin for [age](https://age-encryption.org/v1) clients
like [`age`](https://age-encryption.org) and [`rage`](https://str4d.xyz/rage),
which enables files to be encrypted to age identities sealed by the TPM.

# Features

* Keys created on the TPM, sealed outside of it
* PIN support
* TPM session encryption

# Experimental

The identity format and technical details might change between iterations.
Consider this plugin experimental.

Instead of utilizing the TPM directly, you can use `--swtpm` or `export
AGE_TPM_SWTPM=1` to create a identity backed by
[swtpm](https://github.com/stefanberger/swtpm) which will be stored under
`/var/tmp/age-plugin-tpm`.

Note that `swtpm` provides no security properties and should only be used for
testing.

## Installation

The simplest way of installing this plugin is by running the follow go command.

`go install github.com/foxboron/age-plugin-tpm/cmd/age-plugin-tpm@latest`

Alternatively download the [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/foxboron/age-plugin-tpm/releases).

# Usage

```bash
# Create identity
$ age-plugin-tpm --generate -o age-identity.txt
$ age-plugin-tpm -y age-identity.txt > age-recipient.txt

# Encrypt / Decrypt something
$ echo 'Hack The Planet!' | age -R age-recipient.txt -o test-decrypt.txt
$ age --decrypt -i age-identity.txt -o - test-decrypt.txt
Hack The Planet!
```

You can add `--pin` when calling `--generate` to require a PIN when encrypting or decrypting.

### When used non-interactively

If you want to use a `--pin` non-interactively, you can use the `AGE_TPM_PIN` environment variable.
Please be aware that environment variables are not secure, and can be read from `/proc/$PID/environ`.

```bash
# Create identity
$ AGE_TPM_PIN=1234 age-plugin-tpm --generate --pin -o age-identity.txt
$ age-plugin-tpm -y age-identity.txt > age-recipient.txt

# Encrypt / Decrypt something
$ echo 'Hack The Planet!' | age -R age-recipient.txt -o test-decrypt.txt
$ AGE_TPM_PIN=1234 age --decrypt -i age-identity.txt -o - test-decrypt.txt
Hack The Planet!
```

## Commands

An age identity can be created with:

```
$ age-plugin-tpm --generate -o age-identity.txt

```

To display the recipient of a given identity:

```
$ age-plugin-tpm -y age-identity.txt
age1tpm1qg86fn5esp30u9h6jy6zvu9gcsvnac09vn8jzjxt8s3qtlcv5h2x287wm36
```
